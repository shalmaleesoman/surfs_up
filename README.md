# surfs_up 

## Project Overview

The overview of this project was to review weather data, specifically temperature data for the months of June and December to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business would be successful and sustain.

The following was required:

* determine the summary statistics for the month of June
* determine the summary statistics for the month of December

## Results

The following tables shows the summary of June and December's temperature statistics. 

* Average temperature in June is almost 75 degrees--which is expected.
* The maximum temperature in June is 85 degrees and in December it is 83 degrees, which is shockingly similar.
* The minimum temperature in June is 64 degrees and in December it is 56 degrees, which has a slightly larger difference than the maximum temperatures.


# Summary

When looking at the two tables, the temperatures are so similar it could almost pass for the months to be June and August, instead of June and December. The highs in December are almost as hot as the high's in June, which is a stark difference between the minimum temperatures. 

Different queries that could be run could be the difference in the number of tourists that visit in the month of June versus August. This could also help determine how much inventory to buy for the store in which month, and help analyze revenue better. Another query that could be ran to help have a better analysis would be precipitation difference between June and December.
